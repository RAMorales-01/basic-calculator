This is a small project of an app for the terminal.

The idea was to create a calculator with the basic operands(addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) using what i have learned so far.
As an optional i decided to try to implement manual test since i have never tried those on my previous projects, so using documentation, info form forums like stack overflow and AI(working as an advisor, teaching and providing feedback) i managed to create some basic test for the logic of the calculator.
